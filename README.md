This is an stable diffusion lora model, the training dataset with tag words have been placed in training set file. If you would like to use this model just use the safetensors with weight:1 would be ok.
If you would like to train by you own you could use the json file, I have used Aki's toolkit to train this lora. https://github.com/Akegarasu/lora-scripts
The base model checkpoint is Anylora(LCM), https://civitai.com/models/23900?modelVersionId=256685, this lora perform best in this checkpoint.
